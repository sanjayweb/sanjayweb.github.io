# Podcast Management Dashboard

Information

This HTML conversion is fully custom code, I didn't use any Bootstrap or other framework here. I used Font Awesomeonly for icons and it's fully responsive for all handhelds. Also podcast listing component design is made in liquid form so when we put it into wordpress backend it will fit with available space so we need to repeat only "podcast-card" div card for display podcast listing. 

How to set up the code (if needed) : -

1. Please <section class="podcast-management-dashboard"> add from this line to the end of the page.
2. Please Import master.css and custom.js
3. add font awesome  https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.1/css/all.min.css cdn link.
4. finally need to repeat this div and as per requirement we can display the cards per page through pagination
   <!-- Podcasts Card Start-->
   <div class="podcast-card">
